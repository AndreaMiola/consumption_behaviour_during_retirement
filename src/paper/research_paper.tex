\begin{abstract}
	The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of consumption behaviour after retirement. Literature found a systematic decrease in consumption in contradition of what consumption theory smoothing affirms. Therefore, I decided to replicate the paper of Haider and Stephen (2007) using SHARE data focusing the analysis on a European level. Implementing a fixed effect estimation on panel data I measured the effect on actual year of retirment and on the expected one. The results of this analysis, even though they are not significant, predict a decline in consumption both on the actual and on the expected period.

\label{sec:introduction}

Setting the exact level of saving for retirment, knowing how much consuption we want to spend in the future is really difficult, especcially for the amount of factors that influence this choice: risk adversion coefficient, patience, how preferences could change. Under rational expectation assumptions, one of the pioneer of this topic, Modigliani (1954) developed the lyfe cicle model establishing that consumption should be smoothed across periods of predictably high and low income. However, emiprical studies found that consume decrease sharply during the first year of retirment (Banks et al., 1998; Bernheim et al., 2001; Schwerdt, 2005). This fall is know as "“retirement consumption puzzle”. In comparison, other studies as Aguiar and Hurst (2005, 2013) argue that there is a decline in actual consumption utility at retirement, so not related to consumption puzzeling. They argue that spending, rather than consumption, decreases on the basis that individuals reduce work-related expenditure and overall spending, through more efficient in purchasing and domestic production, as a result of changes in the opportunity cost of time after retirement.
As in Haider and Stephen (2007), in this paper I do not modify the standard life cycle/permanent income hypothesis, but verify if there is a drop in consumption.
